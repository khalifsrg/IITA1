				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>Cultural Background</h3>
					<p>My parents were born and raised in Indonesia and moved to Melbourne, Australia 4 years before I was born, which was the year of 2002. I was raised in Melbourne for all my life, however my parents continued to teach me Indonesian culture and language, allowing me to be able to speak fluent my parents mother tongue. I am extremely grateful to my parents to have taught me to speak a language other than English as it has allowed for me to create relationships with people that I would not have been able to meet without being able to speak it, I also hope to continue to learn to read write in many other languages in order to socialise with more people in the multicultural society that is Melbourne and beyond.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Education</h3>
					<p>I completed my senior year in high school at Australian International Academy (AIA) in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic and it was one of the most stressful years of my life. I am a person who is naturally extroverted and likes the company of others, especially when it comes to finding the motivation to study. I struggled in 2020 and was devastated after finding out my results did not completely reflect my true potential as a student. This has become the essence of my motivation to perform extremely well in my my time at RMIT. My highest qualification is a Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE).</br>
					Younger primary school students in after school coding programs through Invent the World.</br>
					University level education ranging from 1st year to Post Grad students through RMIT on campus and online via Open University Australia</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Interests</h3>
					<p>I am a passionate skateboarder and have been continuously skateboarding for almost 10 years. I was honestly one of my biggest challenges in my senior year of high school to have to neglect my desired to go skateboard and focus on my studies, although it has allowed me to train myself to be able to organise my time and provide adequate time for both my studies along with my hobbies. Another interest I have is fashion, I like to research archived clothing have different concept and designs that display an art that is wearable. I admire fashion designers as it is a hard industry to be original and creating something that is different to other people.</p>

				<h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
			</header>

				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
					<p>My Interest in Information Technology is to be able to fully understand the systems that are hidden within the computers that we own. I find that interesting, and as someone who has little to no experience with computers I am completely new to the world of information technology and it is something that I am willing to study further to eventually uncover new discoveries for myself. Another reason I decided to pursue a career in the field of IT are the vast array of opportunities that are available through the obtained skills learnt in IT. I honestly do not have a specific plan in regard to my future in IT, I am just figuring out which area I enjoy and excel at the most, and will hopefully strengthen my skills in that particular area in IT.</p>

				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h3>
					<p>When I was in year 11 of high school, the idea of deciding where you wanted to go after graduating was prompted to us and as someone who was mainly stressed on how I would get to my friends house after school, I did not have a clue what I wanted to do. I came up with many different ideas including; architecture, filmmaking and even electrician. I do not completely remember how the idea came about, but I remember I overheard someone saying how computer security is a field that is increasing in demand and is a sustainable career path, this would be one of the many factors for my decision to pursue a career in IT. Another reason that sparked my interest in IT was my father who has been working in software architecture for 25+ years. Hearing about all the opportunities and experiences that my father had during his many years of work, it was another factor that inspired me.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
					<p>I chose to come to RMIT after seeing my aunty and my older sister attend the uni. They would bring me onto campus at times and it allowed me to see what the facilities that RMIT provided looked like. It was especially before the coronavirus pandemic, when my sister brought me to the campus to study for my VCE that I was adamant on my decision to put RMIT at the top of my uni preferences in VTAC. Another reason I decided to come to RMIT was the community that surrounded the university, I liked the diversity of the students that attended the campus, not only through nationality and culture, but through their expression of their interests through their style and clubs that are available throughout the uni.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
					<p>I expect to learn how to manipulate the systems and programs to be able to facilitate services and programs for users. I believe that many aspects of information technology can be improved and used to assist in many different industries. Nearly every industry, even those that are not IT related, require some sort of IT in order to run their business or company.

				<img src="Screen Shot 2021-03-18 at 11.10.12 am 2.png">
				<h3>Cyberscurity Lead Advisor</h3>
					<p>A cybersecurity advisor is in charge of acting as the key communicator between security teams and business units. They are the individuals that establish, build and maintain the working relationships with the internal and external stakeholders of the company, in this context it would be AGL. They are in charge of supervising and maintaining situation awareness of cyber security issues and to keep business leaders informed on the status of the problems and updates.</p>
					<p>They maintain stability in the company through educating security communities of interest to raise awareness on different cyber security and IA issues as required. Along with this, they are also the first to reach for credible information and positive security advice. An advisor understands security technology, solutions, processes and procedures and is able to translate technical concepts into business concepts. In essence, a cybersecurity lead advisor manages the team of system architects, designers and business unit facing engineers. </p>
		
				<h3>Why is this position is appealing to me?</h3>
					<p>This position of work is appealing to me as it is my goal to work become a lead advisor in the field of cyber security. I have always been fascinated by the methods in which IT systems are protected. Along with that, I also intend on working my self up to a high position such as an advisor as it is something I desire. I enjoy working hard, and it would genuinely be satisfying for me to be able to finish off my tasks one by one. On top of the previous points, I also intend to earn a higher wage than a regular employee.</p>

				<h3>What are the skills, qualifications and experience for the job?</h3>
					<p>To be accepted into the role the individual must have already been certified in information security and/or have experience with information security as part of an ICT role. They must also possess expert knowledge and experience in IT security and/or ICT policy, particularly computer security, network security and computer network defence.

				<h3>What skills, qualifications and experience do you currently have?</h3>
					<p>I currently have no relevant experience in regards to the job position shown above. However in regards to IT in general, I currently do not have any experience in any areas in the field of information technology. In high school I also did not do the VCE subject for IT as it was not made available in the school I was attending. However I intend to work extremely hard to catch up to those who have experience with the programs and software that we are learning to use, in order to catch up to the people who have experience.</p>
				
				<h3>Brief plan on how I will acquire the experience needed for the job I hope to have:</h3>
					<p>In order to build myself up to obtain the experience in order to achieve the goals that I have set for myself, I have planned on finishing this course and hopefully securing a internship in the third year of the course. I will proceed this by attempting to secure a position at a IT company in order to gain experience. If it is required I will after a few years return to study for a masters degree in cyber security in order to further my knowledge, resulting in a more expansive pool of options in regards to job opportunities.</p>

					<p><a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/"target="_blank">The Big Five Test</a></p>
					<img src="Screen Shot 2021-03-22 at 4.28.18 pm.png">
					<h3>What does this say about me?</h3>
						<p>The first test describes my personality through a series of questions that analyse the different aspects that form someones mind through different scenarios that are presented to the quiz-taker. Although the three tests do not literally dive into someones mind and completely ignore the unbiased choices made by the individual made by the quiz, they outline and present a vague image of the personality of an individual. In my case however it does describe my personality pretty well as I am someone who relies on social interaction in order to distract myself from things that stress me out in my life, which described from my choices in the first test is somewhat often as I am described to be 64% turbulent. As an overall extroverted person it seems right that I am give the role of an analyst and overall a debater as it is very often that I find myself in situations that has me discussing with other people my opinions on certain topics and comparing different thoughts people have on certain subjects.</p>
						<p>In the second test, it analysed my style of learning through a serious of scenarios. This particular test delineates my style of understanding new concepts extremely well. The description states that I am very much not someone who mainly relies on auditory and visual learning but rather I am more of a hands-on learner. This is evident in my recent learning of the new concepts and programs that I have picked up in my first few weeks at university. In this very assignment, I had not fully comprehended how to use a html editor through the examples that I had been shown and read, but rather when I was forced to figure out how to display my work in the form of a web page practically, I was able to efficiently utilise the tools at hand to present my ideas that I wanted to show.</p>
						<p>In the third test, I was given another set of questions which in essence had a similar concept to the first test provided by 16personalities. My results from the first and second tests were further solidified through this personality test as it also stated similar percentages regarding my social and analysis skills, while also contributing a percentage on my imaginative aspect of my mind. </p>
					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
						<p>These results have made me realise the pros and cons of my personality in a group setting. I find my self often fighting for my ideas to be implemented in thd final product and this is due to my debating nature. However this is taken over by my ability to communicate confidently to my teammates as I would say that I am able to politely able to present my ideas to the rest of the groups and through my version of persuasion, sometimes change the minds of the other individuals in the group to agree with my ideas, it can be seen as a positive however to many this is a negative as it clashes with their personality, one which does not tolerate individuals who are stubborn, much like myself.</p>
					<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
						<p>When I am given the opportunity to form a team or group, I will first attempt to suppress my desires to take control of the group and instead keep an open-mind when approaching the group and listening to differing concepts presented by the other members of the group. As someone who knows that it is almost impossible to always be in a group that completely agrees with you ideas it is essential that I must learn to comprehend the different personalities that many other people possess and conform to their way of communicating. If given the chance I would choose people that match the same energy that I exert in order to make the process of cooperation much more streamline.</p>

		<!-- Project Idea Section -->
			<section id="Project">
			<header class="sectionHeading">
				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>

			<section>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>The project that has been chosen is based on the increasing demand for archived fashion from luxury designers. Archive fashion is essentially past collections that have been discontinued from production and it has been a passion for many around the world to collect many different articles of clothing from a variety of designers that show off their work, whether from their consumer-based collections to their runway exclusive clothing. As the culture of archive fashion is based on items that are relatively hard-to-find, the app would facilitate purchasing pieces of clothing that are rare through community and developer assistance. The main goal of the app is to provide a database of the clothes along with the history and the places where it is available to purchase.</p>
				<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>The motivation for the idea presented is due to the increasing demand in the fashion market as a whole. The world of fashion and personal style is one that is practiced throughout the world, whether luxurious or fast fashion. The global retail market generates around $1.34 trillion in sales per year without the inclusion of footwear and jewellery, which are huge areas in fashion individually, which when included, the value of the market increases to around 1 trillion (1).  However, the market is not stopping there, it is expected that in 2021 the value will increase by 8% (1). To put it into perspective, an average US consumer purchases one mid-priced item of clothing per week, this plays into part of the idea that the app will based on, the fact that an individual’s clothing rotates so often that they look for a change and much higher quality clothing in order to increase longevity of the clothes they wear on a day-to-day basis. (2)</p>
				<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The app will consist of many components that would assist the user and overall deliver an enjoyable experience for them. The app will include a camera identifier, a revolutionary new feature that has not been seen in any other website or app that offers similar services. Through the lens of the smartphone or a regular screenshot, the user is able to use their smartphone to quickly identify a piece of clothing that they find interesting and want to know more about. It will be a handy tool for fashion enthusiasts to be able to find pieces they are intrigued about in pictures on social media or in public. The app will use its expansive database in order to assist the user. A section of the app will be reserved for the users to build a community to be able to connect to like-minded people through the app. It will essentially act as a fashion-centric social media. This area will allow users to also express their personal identity through their clothing, while also inspiring other users with their choices of colour combinations and fitting of their chosen pieces of clothing. It is essentially a way for users to share their “art” to others and be appreciated for their creativeness. The database search engine that serves as an efficient method of specifying a users queries throughout out the service. The search engine serves as an integral part of the app as it is one of the most commonly used tools on a program due to it being able to assist the user heavily through easing their searches for products. Mother feature which would differ the app to others available on the internet, is the showcasing aspect, where creators and designers of unique clothing may show their creations and have access to a platform to be able to sell the clothes they make. The links for the websites and listings of the clothes that users intend on purchasing will also be available on the product page, if not available it will simply say out of stock until a listing appears on the web, which will be located by developers or users of the app.  The basics of a clothing database program will be included, such as: brand specific searches, type of garment or accessory specific searches and other components such as a customer assistance service and suggestion section. </p>
					<p>The overall look of the app will be minimalistic to allow for recognition and usability. The intention of the app is for easy learning of the mechanics of the program in order for the user to focus less on how to answer their queries and more on the actual outcome efficiently. It will have a theme that will mimic a virtual vault in order to give a sense of luxuriousness and exclusivity for the user. The app is intended to not look like a tacky website turned app but instead one that looks like it contains the worlds most precious gems.
					</p>
				<h3>Tools And Technologies</h3>
					<p>Using a software such as MIT app developer or App Machine I will essentially create a website first and convert it to an app format as it will allow for use on smartphone as well as computer. It is much more useful as a program and website if it were a website too as it is very often that a user prefers to use their personal computer with the use of browsing through clothing. It will heavily increase traffic for the app and website. There will be elements of augmented reality (AR) for the camera identifying feature that will be primarily based on the app, however screenshots will still be valid for the website. The AR will be developed through Vuforia as it is a commonly used development software used for AR on mobile devices. </p>
				<h3>Skills Required</h3>
					<p>In order to successfully complete the idea that is presented, an individual must learn to master the software described above. The app will not be the result of an amateur programmer or developer as it is something that is not simple in the slightest. The individual must have already created many past project app and websites to have already obtained the skills to complete the application. This can be obtained through the completion of a degree in web development, graphic or communication design along with experience in the field of user centred designed. This can be done through working in companies and obtaining training through the companies assistance and needs.</p>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If the application is successful, the outcome would be a useful tool for archive fashion enthusiasts around the world. It will greatly impact the world of designer clothing as it will remove the troubles of website hopping to search for a piece of clothing that a user may find attractive. It also will allow for creators from all over the world to connect and share their experiences with designing and wearing clothing in order to help interested users. The different feature of the app differ to other fashion apps that are available to the public as it further facilitates access to garments that were originally extremely hard to obtain.</p>
